### CPSC 120

* Lab 11, part 1
Lab 11 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it helped me finally understand how classes work in C++. I liked how we had to fill in the missing functions for the State class and seeing the data from the CSV file connected to the code. This lab helped me understand object oriented programming better, especially how header files and source files work together. It felt rewarding seeing the program correctly find the densest and sparsest states once everything was working. 


* Lab 6, Part 2
Lab 6 part 2 was my favorite lab because it helped me understand how scoring works in Blackjack and how to turn real world rules into code. I liked figuring out how the Ace could be worth either 1 or 11, and making my program decide the best value so the player would not bust. The input validation part also taught me how to check for errors, like if the user did not type two cards or typed something invalid. Overall, this lab made functions feel more useful and showed me how programming can model actual games.


* Lab 9, Part 1
Lab 9 part 1 was my second favorite lab because it was building a real too, kind of like a mini spell checker. I liked how the program had to read a dictionary file and compare it to another text file to find misspelled words. It also taught me how important input validation is, since the program had to check if the user actually gave a filename and if the file existed. This lab helped me get better at using vectors and functions together, and it made me feel more confident about working with files in C++.
